This is the dissemination of my Master's Thesis for Game and Media Technology at Utrecht University. To summarize my thesis:\
A curve arrangement can contain popular faces if a face is bounded the same curve multiple times. Popular faces and closed loops can make generated curved nonogram puzzles complex. To remove these features we make changes to small areas in the curve arrangement. We identify possible local changes in a curve arrangement and test several method that try to make the biggest improvement with the fewest changes.

I worked on this thesis for 10 months. My implementation and experiments were written in c++ and used CGAL, analysis of results was done with Python.

This thesis was supervised by Maarten Löffler and Frank Staals.

Hotel Pluhz is an incremental mobile hotel building persuasive game we developed for our Software Project during my bachelor Computer Science/Game Technology commissioned by Pluhz. The player has to continuously improve their hotel. This process can be accelerated by completing challenges set by chosen lifestyle coaches and general practitioners. These challenges can motivate the player to gain a healthier lifestyle.

This project took 20 weeks. This game was made with Unity3D and C#, we followed the SCRUM methodology and made use of JIRA.

Let Me Help is a asymmetric cooperative 2-player mixed reality game we developed for the course Hybrid Space during my minor Game Design at the Utrecht University of the Arts. One player with a VR headset sits in a wheelchair like controller and has to traverse a virtual maze while avoiding monsters. The other player has a physical model of the maze that contains LED lights to indicate which region the wheelchair player and monster are in. Furthermore, the physical maze has blockades that can be moved to help the wheelchair player. Both players have to work together to escape the maze.

This project took 12 weeks. This game was made in Unity3D and uses Valve's OpenVR and an HTC Vive Pro, the wheelchair controller and physical maze use Arduinos.

Personal responsibilities:\
- Game Design (shared responsibility)
- Wiring the LEDs and gates of the physical maze to an Arduino
- Development of several systems, such as the maze Arduino, sommunication between Unity3D and both Arduinos and the movement of the VR player.

A_Spook_Alypse is a reimagining of Pac-Man we developed for our Introduction Project during my bachelor Computer Science/Game Technology at Utrecht University. The player has to exterminate four Spookiemonsters from an abandoned city by stunning them with collected cookies and trapping them in vacuum bags.

This project took 10 weeks. This game was made in Unity3D with use of C#.
